I am in last quarter of my [tour]({{site.url }}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) in a month I will be landing in my home.

Thanks to [Pratomo Ardianto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ardnet) and [Sepusla](http://sepulsa.com) I have the opportunity to talk with Drupal community in Jakarta about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project.

The attendees had a lot of questions and were very interested in use Drupal 8, but still have some doubt about Drupal 8 modules availability; I hope my answers motivate them to adopt the Drupal 8 usage more soon than later.

Before to attend the meetup I did some sightseeing in Jakarta at

- [National Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Indonesia)
- [Istiqlal Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istiqlal_Mosque,_Jakarta)
- [Jakarta Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Cathedral)

Couples interested things are the Mosque the 3rd biggest mosque in the worlds and inside the Cathedral was a wedding in action at the moment I visited.
