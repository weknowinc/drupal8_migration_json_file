Yesterday was a day of changing a country in the trip; I  couldn't sleep well, only about 2.5 hours.

My flight to Japan departure from Incheon Internation Airport at 8:40 am. When I was packing, I notice the low-cost company I choose to flight to Japan have a 15 KG restriction and almost USD $90 for a second checked luggage.  So, I unwrap my backpacker bag and set everything to leave behind my laptop backpack and some pijamas, if were necessary, due I still have like 6 km over the weight limit. 

Fortunately, the airline doesn't say anything about my luggage, and I can continue with all my stuff.

The Narita airport is huge but well organized, after passing control I can get a sim card with Internet connection, and the information desk tries to explain to me that there are several train operators and different kind of trains. Finally, I choose the cheapest one. The Narita airport is quite remote from Tokio.

In my hotel I try to prepare my schedule for this week, this week will be agitated with two sessions in Tokio, a trip an overnight trip to Osaka and a meeting in Osaka.

Looking the top places to visit in my short period in Tokyo, I found a website that helps me to organize my tour [http://www.visitacity.com](http://www.visitacity.com). I have to say I am on a hook with this web application, how I can live without this before :P/
