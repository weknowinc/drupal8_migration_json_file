Second Drupal meetup in Indonesia, this time in Yogyakarta a small city according to Indonesian standards, but almost bigger than Costa Rica :P.

This meetup was organized by [Skyshi](http://skyshi.com) a local Drupal workshop; The audience was really excited about seeing [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project running using the Indonesian language, at least partially.

In the meetup were some non-Drupal developers, from Joomla, Javascript, and Wordpress community.

During the day, I expend almost all my morning looking a shoe shop to find a replacement for my sneakers and testing the perfect ones, the ones I bring with me were of poor shape, due all the walking I do every day.

In sightseeing area, I visited the [Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraton_Ngayogyakarta_Hadiningrat) part of the Sultan Palace. The Sultan is the Governor and the owner of the land in the region.
