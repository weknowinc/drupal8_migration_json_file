As you maybe don't know, not everything is about traveling. Yesterday I expended most of my morning to define with [Jesus Olivas](http://jmolivas.com) the next steps to be a little more close to the version 1.0.0. Stable for [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project our most important issue "Composer compatibility."

Back to the sightseeing, we went first to [Pearl Harbour Historic Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_Memorial). Was impossible to visit the memorial for people who died during Japanese attack due the wind and due the ticket ran out early in the morning all days.

Fortunately, the area has other military museums, and I visited fist the [
[USS Bowfin Submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bowfin_(SS-287)), my first submarine and even that the vessel was old was quite interesting.

The second museum was the [USS Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)) this battleship is important because on this ship the Japanese Empire sign their surrender and end the World War II.

But, we were in Hawaii; So, we just choose a random place on the map, and I drove to explore the island, we visited the [Haleiwa Beach Park](http://www.gohawaii.com/treks/oahu/haleiwa-beach-park.html). As you can imagine an awesome place, I love the fact in all this park on the beach you could find public showers, bathrooms, and free parking.

To finish our day, we decided to find a place to see the sunset and on the map, we see there a beach named "Sunset Beach" so the decision wasn't  hard.

At the end of the day, I complete a spin around the island.
