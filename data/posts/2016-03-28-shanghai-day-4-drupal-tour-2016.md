After some drinks with friends after DrupalCamp China, I get up late and also in conjunction with the fact that there is no spring yet in China makes hard to get off from bed.

My day wasn't busy yesterday I just take brunch in Shanghai downtown and walk to the [Yuyuan Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Garden) area.

The Yuyuan area is a place with a lot of shops related to jewelry and traditional Chinese products. Almost by accident I found the **Yuyuan** garden and get it, the garden has lots of canals, pavilions and tea houses, decorated with ancient rocks, the garden is huge so easily you can spend like 2 or more walking around the park.

Back home, I just did some laundry, watch couples movies and thinking and planning a little bit about my trip to Indonesia.
