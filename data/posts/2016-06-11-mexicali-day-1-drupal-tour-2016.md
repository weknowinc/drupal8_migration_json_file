Slowly I have to return to normality; I spend most of my day working with [Jesus Olivas](http://jmolivas.com) in Drupal Console project.

In general we work defining next steps to try to achieve the version 1.0.0 stable for Drupal Console, and also I start my diligences to try to attend [DrupalCon Dublin](events.drupal.org/dublin2016), like pay my ticket, request a visa letter and apply for  a grant to attend this event.

At the end of the day, we went with Jesus's family to a North Mexican Grill, and we walk a little bit in Jesus alma mater.
