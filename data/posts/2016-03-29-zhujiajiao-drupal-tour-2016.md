The village of **Zhujiajiao** is an older city, found about 1700 years ago that preserve their architecture and bridges, with my shop to satisfy your Chinese fever of souvenir.

The most unusual activity we did was fish massage which consists in you putting your feets in a thank and little starving fishing try to eat your skin and of course, we took a trip in a boat.
