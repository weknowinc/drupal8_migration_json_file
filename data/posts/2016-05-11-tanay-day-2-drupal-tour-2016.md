Last day in Sampaloc, Tanay.  I discover that Sampaloc means "Tamarindo" in Spanish.

Early in the morning **Paul de Paula** and I went out to [Daranak Falls](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/Attraction_Review-g2336235-d3445865-Reviews-Daranak_Falls-Tanay_Rizal_Province_Calabarzon_Region_Luzon.html) a resort administrated for local government.

Paul told me that this place is usually crowded, but due was Tuesday there were only a few people and old locals.

We were lucky the get in the falls first, and the place was only for us short a period; Meanwhile, the others settle down to expend all day near.

After having lunch with **Paul and Gem** my hosts in Sampaloc, I departure back to Manila in a Van.

In Manila I had to go to a shopping mall to find a suitcase due the one I had to suffer damage in my trip from Taiwan to the Philippines; To be honest that bag support more than expected 90 days and 16 airports. The Suitcase is dead long live the Suitcase.
