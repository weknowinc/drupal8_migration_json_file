Last week and a half I had the opportunity of returning to Australia to participate in my first [DrupalSouth](2016.badcamp.net) as part of my tour [Around the Drupal world in 180+ days](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-day).


The [DrupalSouth](https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au)  has held in the Australian City of [Gold Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland) a surfers paradise place with a lot of parties around.

During Drupal South pre-event activities, I lead a **Drupal 8 Module Development training** for 15th students from several cities of Australia and one student from [Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa)

The first official day I lead the session **Learn Drupal 8 via debugging** with a great assistance.

At last day, I had the honor to lead the closing Keynote with the session **The Art of Contributing**, where I have the opportunity to explain my point of view about *"Why investing in community its a good business"*

In general was a great experience and I hope the people who attend the Drupal South enjoy as much as I did, I hope I would have the opportunity to attend the next Drupal South in Auckland, New Zealand.

On my way back to home I just stop in Melbourne to visit couple friends, not Drupal related, because not everything is about Drupal :P.

With this trip, my #enzotour16 its officially over, in a month I will write recap entry with statistics and thoughts about my experience.
