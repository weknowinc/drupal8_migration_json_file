With the return of the activity in Beijing after their last festival, the quality of air is getting worst and worst, but I am here, and I have to try to go out to see the city and places around. So, my last stop was at the [Summer Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace).

The summer palace is located about one hour from Beijing downtown, are an enormous place with a lot of trails, pavilion, temples, canals and houses. The only problem is that everything is situated on a hill, therefore,  a lot of stairs.

In the other side of the hill there a lake, I skip the tour in the lake due the view wasn't good due the quality of air, maybe in summer is better.
