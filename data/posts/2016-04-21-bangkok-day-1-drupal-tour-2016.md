For about two months the temperature of place I have been visiting fluctuate between 1 Celsius degrees to 21 Celsius degrees; Yesterday I arrive in Bangkok, Thailand, and the weather punch me so hard, having a 32 Celsius degrees is not easy to less walk and more taxi in this part of my trip.

For my sightseeing, I follow a guide prepared by [Michael Ledu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mledu) a friend from NYC and married with a Thailand girl.

So, following his advice, I went out first into [Jim Thompson House](http://www.jimthompsonhouse.com) wich is an excellent tour of a somewhat traditional Thai house that is rare in Bangkok.

After that visit, I tried to walk but as I said before the heat was overwhelming, so I took a taxi to [Rattanakosin Exhibition Hall](http://www.nitasrattanakosin.com). This museum is well organized and they have three guides tours, but it's literally a guided tour, room after room they have a person that explain to you what is the exhibition about, and they have devices to listed audios in English for the videos the present.

The list of tours are:

- **Grandeur Rattanakosin**
- **The colorful Thai of living**
- **The heart and soul of the nation**

Indeed was a great introduction to Thai culture and their history.

Walking around I found [The Golden Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Saket) which is a is a Buddhist temple in a mountain, that place provide a beautiful view of the city, and I like the option of playing giant gongs.
