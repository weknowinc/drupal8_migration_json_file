I just realise that less picture to share means I had more interaction with people, which it's good.

This day starts with a keynote by [Danese Cooper]( http://danesecooper.blogs.com) and his talk was about milestones in the Drupal project and Open source in India, giving recognition to leaders in India community, I guess was a good way to encourage local community.

After the keynote, volunteers and local organizers, performance a flash mob using India songs.  I have to say it was magnificent; they use the stage and aisles, so at any time, you were surrounded by an Indian dancer, cool moment folks.

I was glad in attending the session [How to build a sustainable contribution culture in your organization](https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/how-build-sustainable-contribution-culture-your-organization) lead by [Ashish Thakur](https://www.drupal.org/u/a_thakur) and [Manjit.Singh](https://www.drupal.org/u/manjitsingh) they explain that everybody could share and support Open Source and how some ways to do that in your organization.

I expend the rest of my day talking with people in the hall of the event, about nothing and everything. I found that Indians were so glad and proud of held this event, and they must be especially proud; the event was really well organized.

Sadly, all good things come to an end, and I have to say good bye to new friends and miss the contribute sprint due I have to continue in my [#enzotour16]({{site.url }}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) Next stop **Singapore**.

I have a recommendation for travelers, arrive at the airport with time because I expend 90 minutes from queuing to claim my boarding passing security controls.
