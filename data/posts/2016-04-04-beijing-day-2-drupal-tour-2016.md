It's pretty normal in our lives to take somethings granted, in my case as a person living in Costa Rica, quality of air is one of them. I didn't remember the last time I see the sky back home to check the color, but here in Beijing is the first thing I do then I reach the street.

Fortunately for me, yesterday was another [APEC Blue Sky](http://www.ibtimes.com/apec-blue-skies-fail-cheer-beijing-residents-government-rushes-clean-air-ahead-summit-1721371) in Beijing.

I started my day visiting [Zhongshan_Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan_Park_(Shanghai)) which is a flower park with some pavilion and trail decorated.

Next to the part is the main entry to the [Forbidden City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City) which was the resident of China emperors and have an enormous quantity of squares and palaces, takes me about 3 hours walking across, but it's worth the effort.
