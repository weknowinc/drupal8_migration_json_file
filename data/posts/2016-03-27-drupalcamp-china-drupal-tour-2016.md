The main reason to be in Shanghai is to participate in DrupalCamp China. The DrupalCamp China was organized in conjunction with BarCamp; the organizers split the event into two rooms, one for Chinese speakers and one for English speakers.

The keynote was presented by [Jacob Reeding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobredding) and talk about the second wave of Open Source and the engagement with the community as companies and individuals.

After the group photo, I have the opportunity to meet with some online friends from Shanghai. Also, I meet with some people that organizing events in Chengdu and Chongqing where I am going to participate, and we have a delicious lunch Chinese style.

In the afternoon, I attend the session of [Adam Malone](https://www.adammalone.net/about) about how to do an effective demo; I love this session because he shows us how to sell Drupal by showing possibilities and not teaching about Drupal in low level.

Right after, I have the opportunity to talk about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project, I was real that I can show the Drupal Console in action using the Chinese language, the room was totally occupied, and I got good questions at the end.
