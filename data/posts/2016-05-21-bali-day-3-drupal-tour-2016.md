I have to confess that I am a little anxious to meet with my wife again in Australia tomorrow and then in few days departure to home.

Despite my homesick, I still try to enjoy alone Bali. I went out to a tourist trap named "Turtle Island" where I have to rent a boat to go to a kind of zoo, I complain about the price and treat to leave the place, and immediately they give 50% of the price. To be honest was fair because I use the boat alone.

In the "island" or "zoo" they have turtles or course, iguanas, snakes, owls, among others animals.

In the second place, I visited the [Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Wisnu_Kencana) cultural park; I place where you can take some pictures of those mythological goods of Indonesia culture and learn about their legend.

At last, but not least; I visit the [Uluwatu Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluwatu_Temple), where the less important think is the temple. The temple is close and what I could see is in bad shape. But, the view, oh the view, was utterly breathtaking, with the breeze, cliffs and a road along the cliffs. A place to visit if you are in Bali.

Ahh there are also a lot of monkeys, and they try to robbery people stuff, but only if you pay attention to them, I just walk ignoring them and done.
