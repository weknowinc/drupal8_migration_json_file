Leaving a city is almost a weird feeling in this trip, because, I have to leave behind a lot of fantastic people and in Shanghai I met a lot of good fellas.

On my way to the subway station, something itches in my brain; I didn't realise what it is until the last moment. What is that well I was about to going to the wrong airport. Shanghai has two airports the [PVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Pudong_International_Airport) I used this airport when I arrive and the [SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Hongqiao_International_Airport) in the totally opposite directions. Fortunately, I double check, and I could fix my direction; otherwise, I will miss my flight for sure. 

At Beijing airport, a member of [Think Drupal](thinkindrupal.com) the only Drupal workshop in Beijing pick up me at the airport and help me to reach my hotel.

At night, I meet with the rest of the team of **Think Drupal**, was a reunion, because, I meet [Howard Ge](https://www.drupal.org/u/g089h515r806) 3 years ago in [DrupalCon Portland](https://portland2013.drupal.org).

As is expected we ended up in a Chinese restaurant to enjoy Chinese food Beijing style, but not any restaurant they invite me to [Quanjude Peking Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanjude) which a restaurant with a restaurant with a lot of history.
