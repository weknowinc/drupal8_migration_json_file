Yesterday started as a quite day, I was a little worry about I could buy my bus ticket to Osaka, in the website they were sold out. 

Fortunately [Kyoko Ohtagaki](https://twitter.com/kyoko_oh) helps me to make a reservation on an online site, but, the adventure doesn't end there, I have to to a convenience store to use a machine with multifunctional functions to print and pay my bus ticket.

The machine was there, and she send me some instructions, check below, but all is in Japanese, so was so scary, because, what are the changes to screw the process following a Japanese guide? Thanks to the convenience store staff they help and they were a little confuse too and like after 10 minutes I got my ticket, and I am ready to go to Osaka.

Looking a place to lunch, I decided to talk towards [Meiji Jingu Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine) located in a beautiful park next to the famous [Shibuya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya)

To end my date, I visit the [CI&T](http://www.ciandt.com/card/tokyo-japan) offices in Japan, where I did a session about Drupal 8 introduction and a session about Drupal Console to the local team.

In *CI&T* offices were the CEO and founder [Cesar Gon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesargon) and [Leonardo Mattiazzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmattiazzi) VP, Innovation at CI&T, really nice folks I have to say. 

I didn't know, but after the session, they have a night of wine and dinner to say goodbye to the current office, because they are expanding their operation in Japan and will change the office in three months, was a great night.
