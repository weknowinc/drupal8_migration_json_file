Last week  I had the opportunity of participate in my 6th DrupalCon and my second European DrupalCon.

But, to be honest, this one is the most important DrupalCon for me until now, I know the first one it's always especial, but in this case, represent a lot for me, because the relevance as speaker in this event.

I have been in a roller coaster of emotions since I was notified that my proposal to present as Community Keynote was accepted; Since that moment I have been working a lot to try to provide the best material I could do to try to share with the community my view and perception of global Drupal Community.

During my keynote, I talk about the tour [Around the Drupal world in 140+ days](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days) and I present some proposals I think that could be implemented improve the engagement with the global community because right now I think we are an international community, but we need to be global.

But, before the keynote, I participate as co-presenter with [Jesus Manuel Olivas]() my business partner at [weKnow](http://weknowinc.com).

Our first session was [Drupal Console: An overview of the new Drupal CLI](https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/drupal-console-overview-new-drupal-cli).

The second session was [Learn the new things in Drupal 8 via debugging](https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/learn-new-things-drupal-8-debugging)

The cherry on the cake were the B.OF.s [Writing Moder CLI commands for Drupal 8](https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/bofs/writing-modern-cli-commands-drupal-8) and [Improving your Drupal 9 development workflow with Composer](https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/bofs/improving-your-drupal-8-development-workflow-using-composer) that Jesus and I lead during Drupal Con.

Last, but not least; I had the opportunity to participate in Code Sprints to try to advance in our goal to have the first release 1.0.0 stable for [Drupal Console project](http://drupalconsole.com).

In general, I am very satisfied with the comments and feedbacks from the Drupal community; Now I could say I have a lot of ideas to contribute via code and community hacks to try to improve as a product as well as a community.
