Yesterday was a relaxed day, with [Yersika](http://yersika.com) we decided just to visit some spots in the city without any particular program. We just roam in the city.

Our fist sport was the [St Patrick's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick%27s_Cathedral,_Melbourne).

Because was close we also visited the [Parliament of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Victoria).

Melbourne is famous for his tram systems and a good think in this system is that inside the [CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district) the trams are free.

Also, there is a free [City Circle Tram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Circle_Tram) that surround the district. After took this tram we stop in couple park just to walk and take some pictures. We enjoy the [Flagstaff Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff_Gardens).

At the end of the day, we had a dinner with some classmates of *Yersika* in a Korean restaurant.
