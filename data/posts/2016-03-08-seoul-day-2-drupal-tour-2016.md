Yesterday I started my day doing a lot of social networks, because, the elections for next Drupal Director at Large in [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org) is open  [https://assoc.drupal.org/vote2016](https://assoc.drupal.org/vote2016).

Therefore, I try to contact as many people as possible I have been in touch with Drupal related matters on all my social networks and IM systems around the world. Fortunately, they are a lot, and I like the idea of requesting the vote one by one and also requesting in community forums by country I use to share my contributions.

Of course, I didn't finish today, likely I have more day in elections process to continue with this process.

Back into Seoul exploring, with my wife, we decided to do some hiking, and we have a long walk today from our hotel walk towards the famous [N Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Seoul_Tower) located in a **Namsan mountain**. There is a **Namsan Park** in the mountain with roads to do hiking or jogging with facilities for sight impaired people.

In addition to the distance, the route was challenging due Seoul was yesterday between 3 to 5 Celcius degrees.

To return,  we took the [Namsan cable car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namsan_cable_car), because, we were exhausted; I know I know I am not in a got shape :P.
