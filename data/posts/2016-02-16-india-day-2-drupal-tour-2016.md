After passing my first day in India, I felt comfortable about how to handle this country as a tourist, so the sky is the limit, I said to myself. I was so wrong "The tuk-tuks are the limit".

I start my day decided to visit the south of Mumbai; I expected more traffic that the day before because was Sunday. But as soon I tried to request my Uber I notice there aren't car available in UberX or UberBlack models, so weird right, the situation gets worse when some cars appear available, but the rate was increased until 8.X.

Trying to understand the situation, I did the supposition maybe people start their days in the office around 9 or 10 am, so I skip the Uber to avoid the rush hour, and I decide to walk towards airtel office to try to get connected to The Internet from my cellphone. 

I bring in theory the requirement to get a sim card from [Airtel](http://www.airtel.in/): passport, a passport copy, a photo and copy of visa. But, the manager of the shop said I need a valid visa for at least 90 days to get sim cards, WTF right. For that reason, I had to call to India 911 in my case I contact [Parth Gohil](https://axelerant.com/team-member/parth-gohil/), and he rescue me request a sim card for him, lucky me he had two photographs in his wallet, BTW, who has two pictures in his wallet nowadays just in case :P.

Having a sim card, but not connected yet because the activation process takes 24 hours, Parth explain to me that maybe the user rise in prices was related with the Tuk-tuks, or Rickshaws, as they are named in India, were in Strike, as soon he mention I realize the street looks different. So, I decided to Stay couple hours in Parth hotel's room until the Rickshaws apocalypse past.

At lunch time, [Cary Gordon](https://www.drupal.org/u/highermath) a former Drupal Association board member and [Ashwini Kumar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashwinikumar7) a developer from Srijian join us and we went to a Punjabi restaurant, food, and talk was so good that we forget to take a picture of us in the restaurant. Shame on us. 

After lunch Rickshaws, ther appocalypse still happen, but Uber prices reach a moderate 1.6 price factor. So Cory and I went to visit Bandra Fort and Carter Road at Bandra West.

I have to say that my conversation with Cory was exquisite because the told me about his experience as a board member of Drupal Association member.

To end the day, I had a dinner with [Josef Dabernig](http://dasjo.at/).

it's good to have time to talk with members of the Drupal community. In my concern the DrupalCon Asia started today.
