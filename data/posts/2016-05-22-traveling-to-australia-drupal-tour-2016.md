Before to departure to Australia, I spend couple hours with my Indonesian friend Suryanto. Thanks to him I was able to visit Indonesia to meet a lot of awesome people. Thanks Suryanto for inviting me and help me with my visa process.

After having lunch in Bali I departure to Melbourne, Australia where I finally reunite with my wife [Yersika](http://yersika.com).

Next weeks will be full of activities and sightseeing, but fortunately, I have my companion.
