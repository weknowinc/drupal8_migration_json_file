Yesterday, I finished my short visit to Hong Kong; Next time I have to reserve more days in this city.

[Chris Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amouro), from [Fliegen](https://fliegen.com.tw/) help me to organize a Drupal Meetup to talk about **Drupal 8** and **Drupal Console**.

The audience was small but very receptive, in few days, I will visit a couple of Drupal offices to continue the conversation.

Also, I reach 2/3 of my Drupal Tour, only 40 days to finish my tour and go home.
