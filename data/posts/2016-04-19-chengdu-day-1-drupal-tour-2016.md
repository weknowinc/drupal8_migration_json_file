I didn't have too much time in Chengdu only two nights, but I decided to visit Chengdu for two reasons a Drupal Meetup and to see the famous [Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_Research_Base_of_Giant_Panda_Breeding).

A lot of people hear at least hear that there a place in China with a lot of Pandas, well this place in Chengdu. Fortunately, I have a local guide from Drupal Community; [Peter](http://leilei.libruce.cn) who companion me to the **Giant Panda Breeding** and other places in Chengdu.

The Panda base in a vast area that hosts a project to protect panda population and execute programs to try to increase the population. For tourists like me, they have some pandas living in a "controlled environment." Outside the regular pandas, they also have a reservoir for "Red Pandas" if you are not familiar with that animal, just think is [Firefox](firefox.com) browser logo, the animal is a Red Panda, not a fox.

After lunch, we move on towards [Kuanzhai Xiangzi](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/sichuan/chengdu/wide-narrow-alley.htm) which are old streets where you can find a lot of restaurants, snacks places, and Chinese handcrafts.

Maybe the most interesting thing I found in this place was a kind of mini theater that presented [Sichuan Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuanese_opera), this style combines music, comedy, magic and kung fu, I totally recommend this activity.
