Today I join to my wife [Yersika](http://yersika.com) at Singapore airport.

After landing was easy to get a SIM card with 5 GB internet by 50 SGD, warning, do you have to change or create a new AP in your phone settings. 

We buy a three days card to use the [Mass Rapid Transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) by SGD 30 each one and using the website [http://gothere.sg/maps](http://gothere.sg/maps) we receive instructions about how to get home.

After checking we decided to go to the famous, [Orchard road](http://www.orchardroad.org) and avenue full of parks and shopping centers, I found nice that there a lot of sceneries available to people to take pictures of themselves all along the road.

Using foursquare we search for a Ramen restaurant and, to be honest, we get lost, because the restaurant was located underground. We discover that there a huge mall underground connected with subway stations and were more people doing shopping and eating than about on the surface, we didn't find our restaurant, so we chose a Pho restaurant and was a good desition.

With our energies restored, we walk toward [Fort Canning Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Canning) located on a hill, be prepare to walk a lot and climb hundreds step to reach the top of the hill, the part have the ruins of an ancient fort.

Next to the part we found the [National Museum of Singapore](http://nationalmuseum.sg) where we learn a little bit about the history of Singapore, the entry it's free, and there are some feature expositions, I thunk we will return at some point this week.

Our tour today ends at the museum, due we felt so tired and is better to retrieve and regroup our forces for the rest of week.

You will notice I publish fewer pictures than usual when I am with my wife, due she had a real camera and took better pictures than me. 

I have to say this state city is fantastic, everything works like a charm, I am looking forward seeing more awesomeness tomorrow.
