This city is well known for their beaches, but due we are in the middle of autumn there is not a time to swim, just to see the place.

We visit the St Kilda beach and his pier; the view is beautiful. I discover a kind of a reservoir for Penguins at the end of the pier, every night after 9 pm they arrive to sleep in the rocks.

In the afternoon, my friend [Andres Sayago](http://sayago.info) prepare a Colombian dish named "Mute Santandearo". The friendship with Andres is a little weird; because we meet online about 15 years ago, and we continue talking about tech stuff over these years but never meet in person until last week, So I could say we were the digital version or [Pen Pals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_pal)
