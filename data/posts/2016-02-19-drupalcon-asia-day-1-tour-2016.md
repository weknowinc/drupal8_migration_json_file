As usual the day before the DrupalCon official start, code sprints and summits like Business, Community and Government takes place, I have to say there a lot of people came to the sessions.

I decided to participate in Government summit, where [J.A.M](http://horn.cologne/) led a lecture about Drupal in Government, and after that, I attend a session led by [Natalie Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-taylor-00a67012) "Successful digital transformation of UK government departments."

After that, I just go out to say hello to some friends and try to meet new ones. The organization offers an exquisite Indian food menu for lunch.

With all energies I get in Contribute code sprint to help to  [Pratomo Ardianto](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ardnet) who wants to contribute a new language for [DrupalConsole](http://drupalconsole.com) to Indonesian.

To finish my day in Drupal Con Asia, I attended the panel "Roadblocks and Challenges" as part of Government summit.

To end my day, I just chill out in Chillis with some members of Taiwan community.

As part of Government Summit, Ani Gupta, the organizer offers a party in Rude Lounge, nothing hardcore as parties at DrupalCons in the USA, but better than Drupalcons in Europe

Today the DrupalCon continue with open sessions, and I will lead the B.O.F [DrupalConsole in Hindi/हिन्दी: Doing Drupal 8 code without speaking English/अंग्रेजी बोले बिना Drupal 8 मे कोड कर](https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/bofs/drupalconsole-hindi%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%80-doing-drupal-8-code-without-speaking-english%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87) I will report my experience tomorrow.
