Yesterday I wanted to return to the sightseeing activity, for that reason I tried for maximizing my coverture of [Kansai Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region), visiting [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Prefecture) the ancient Imperial capital of Japan.

The trip to **Kyoto** takes about 90 minutes, for that reason I decided only visit the first four spot I could visit. 

I started my visit at [Kinkaku-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkaku-ji) or *Temple of the Golden Pavilion*

Outside the temple, I saw a map where were pointed to two nearby locations to visit by walk, that lead me to [Ryōan-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dan-ji) a Zen temple well preserved with lovely trails.

The third place was the best in my opinion, [Ninna-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninna-ji) temple a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**, The entry allow you walk through ancient halls and alleys.

After all that walk I was exhausted, so, I decided to find a random place to take a lunch, but after a long walk, I found the **Hōkongō-in** Temple, located just in from of a train station, so I decided to visit the temple and return to Osaka.
