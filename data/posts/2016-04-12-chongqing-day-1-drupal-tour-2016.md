Usually, Mondays are a difficult day to start in a new city on this trip due; almost all sightseeing is close on Mondays, but it's what it's.

So, I started my day figure out how to buy a city card in the subway, getting some cash and looking for [Ciqikou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciqikou,_Chongqing) sometimes call a little Chongqing and for me is like a cultural [inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception); Because is a Chinatown inside China.

**Ciqikou** It's a place full of Chinese shop local food and all you can expect in a Chinatown district, but the part that was missing is not Asian people, I guess I was the only, not Asian person there.

Inside middle of the old city, I visit the **Bao Lun Buddhist Temple**, beautiful and cheap I have to admit.

In the end, the challenging task was to try to get a not hotpot lunch in the tourist area because that is the most interesting food of **Chongqing** but I had one last night, and I want a change. Finally, I got some noodles non-spicy, and I consider that a triumph.

I decided to return to literally recharge batteries; I have time to plan a little bit my visit to Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, looks like that meetups are settled down and I found a hotel in Bangkok.

After taking a nap, I go out to have a dinner with [Jungle](ranqiangjun.com)

We finish our night walking and talking, and we end up in a bookstore where he gave a Chinese book for children.
