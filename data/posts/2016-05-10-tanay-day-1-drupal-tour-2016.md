Elections Day in the Philippines, to elected President, Vice-president, Senators, Mayors, and councilors. I found interested some fact of Pilipinos elections

The vote is electronic, people fill out a multiple choice form and then introduce in a machine that read, and voters review a receipt showing what the machine read,  and if they confirm the receipt and form are stored in the device.

Voters register their point finger fingerprint and get an ink mark in their nail to avoid anyone vote again.

The military forces can vote.

Propaganda outside the schools where people vote is not allowed. Here some pictures of the experience of elections after companion **Paul de Paula** to vote.
