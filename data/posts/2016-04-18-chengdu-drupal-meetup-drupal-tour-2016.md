After Drupal Camp Chongqing I departure to Chengdu, this city is famous due they host the biggest Panda reservoir in the world, but also they have a local Drupal Community.

To reach Chengdu I took a High-Speed train, operated by [China Railway High-speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Railway_High-speed]). The service is comfortable and efficient, even the fact I was in **second class** I have a huge space for me and my huge backpack. The train sometimes reaches 296 km by an hour, but you don't feel the speed, at times we run in parallel with a highway, and you can notice the cars looks slow in compare with the train.

Maybe in the sad news, I have to report I lost my phone. I lost between last subway station and my walk to train station, nobody stole just felt down from my bad I notice because my extra battery charge impact the floor and I hear the sound but due my phone protector I couldn't hear.

Right after arriving in Chengdu, I move towards to the [Chengdu University of Technology](http://www.cdut.edu.cn/english). During this meetup, I have the opportunity to lead an introduction to Drupal 8 and a Introduction to Drupal Console. Thanks to [Bruce](http://blog.libruce.cn) becuase he translate to Chinese my words for almost 3 hours and also organize the meetup with **Skip**.

After having a delicious dinner, the locals help me to buy a new phone, I just realize that Lenovo bought Motorola and now and rebranding a new brand of phones named **Zuk** and I bought a **Zuk 1**
