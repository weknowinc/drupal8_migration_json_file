It's time to say goodbye to Singapore, and prepare our next trip, In our morning we start to define the route for [Yersika](http://yersika.com) to Australia and after several options, we find a reasonable price flight traveling between SEL &#8594; MEL &#8594; BNE &#8594; HNL.

Guess what we have a dim sum again, no new ones so no #foodporn  today :P.

To go to the airport, we use the [SMRT](https://www.smrt.com.sg/). I have to repeat I love the transport system of Singapore, at the airport station we return four tourist cards, and they return 40 SGD. So basically, we only expend **80 SGD** =  **57.13 USD** for two persons during six days and bargain from my point of view.

To try to be prepared for Vietnam I choose to change my latest Singaporean Dollars, and I got 1.5 million ( 3 notes) Vietnamese dongs, wow was the first time in my life that amount of money in my wallet.

Now I can evaluate the airport better; they offer a movie theater for free and free wi-fi, so all you need for an extended stop in Singapore. At passport control, they ask you for a little piece of paper that they gave your when you enter in Singapore. The security control is not general; each gate has his own luggage check-in procedure. So, by far the best airport  I have ever seen in my life.

We choose Vietnam Airlines to flight to Vietnam; the flight was comfortable, and the duration from Singapore is almost 3 hours, and they provide good food.

The entry in Vietnam was quite easy; we don't have to fill out an immigration form, they just check your passport and in luggage control they don't require to pass through x-ray machines.

The [DrupalCamp Vietnam](http://drupalcamp.vn) organizers, arrange a taxi driver to wait for us at the airport, Hanoi is quite better that I was expecting, being honest, I don't see any communist spirit and nothing looks worst than capitalist countries in Latin America.

We finish our day eating Viet food in the street, was cheap and delicious.
