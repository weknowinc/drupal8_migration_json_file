On my [tour]({{site.url }}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/) this was the shorter stop, only two days. So I get up early and try to visit couple places in the morning just to have a glance of Chengdu.

Firstly, I decided to visit the **Manjusri Monastery** or Wenshu Monastery/文殊院, which is a buddies temple, with a lot of monks inside and looks like there are residences for them behind the temples.

I was a little worry about the traffic, so I have other places in my list, but I  prefer to walk around to check, and I see, and I found the **Aidao Nunnery** or Ancient Yuanjue Nunnery. This temple was reconstructed this century and have a good shape and nice decorations.

At the afternoon, I said goodbye to China and departure to Bangkok, Thailand. I know you could say, but you will go to Hong Kong and Taiwan, well those are other Chinas like Singapore.
