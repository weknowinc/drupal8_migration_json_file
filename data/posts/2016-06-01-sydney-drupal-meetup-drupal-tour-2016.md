My last stop in Australia is in Sydney, commonly confuse as the capital of Australi, (I will not say which in the correct capital, Google it). 

I flew from Melbourne just on time to participate in the Sydney Drupal Meetup; I am glad the local group opens a space to talk about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) with them.

The reception was great, and I receive a lot of questions and new ideas to be included in Drupal Console.

The meetup organizer gave a fancy Australian wine, I didn't see that coming, thank you so much, guys.

Couple things I found interesting about Sydney. 

The subway has wagons of two stories.

It's possible to request an Uber car to pickup inside the aiport.
