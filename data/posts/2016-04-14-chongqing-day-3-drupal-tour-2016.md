The DrupalCamp Chongqing helps me, asking a person to help me to buy a ticket to Chengdu and she also lead me to some places to met the Chongqing City.

My companion was **Lihong Liu** a student of computer science at a local university. She helps me to buy a ticket for a High-Speed train to Chengdu.

Our first stop was in a rope cable over the [Yangtze river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze) the biggest river of China and the third in the world.

Back in the CBD area on Chongqing, we visited the [Louchan Temple](https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Attraction_Review-g294213-d2068790-Reviews-Chongqing_Luohan_Temple-Chongqing.html), where Liu explains to me a little bit about differences between Buddhist and Taoist.

Our tour finished at [Hongyadong](http://www.chongqingtrip.org/attractions/hongyadong.htm), which a complex of hotels, restaurants, shops. So another Chinatown inside China, but is famous also because a night you can take boat to take picture and the complex is illuminated providing a lovely landmark, but I didn't have time to wait until the sunset

At night, I have a dinner with **Jungle** and he gave a t-shirt for Drupal Camp and another to spare in my next trip.
