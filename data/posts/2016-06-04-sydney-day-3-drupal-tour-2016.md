Although we are in autumn, most of the day was sunny and warm. That allow us to walk in the city.

We visited the most emblematic building in the area the [Queen Victoria Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria_Building).

Near to the building the [St Andrew's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Sydney), nothing especial but still a lovely building.
