In our last days in Australia, we decided to explore something out of the city, and we hire a tour to the Blue Mountains.

To be fair the days was more gray than blue because autumn in Sydney and surrounded areas means rainy and windy days.

Our first stop almost pay the ticket we visited the [Featherdale_Wildlife_Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherdale_Wildlife_Park) a mini zoo with a lot of Australian animals. Indeed, the main attraction is the Koalas; By the way, the Koalas are so cute, another animal that took my attention was the [Wombat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat) which is also adorable, and I never hear about this animal before.

Later on, we ended up in [Katoomba Scenic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba_Scenic_World) a place where in Theory we could see the majestic [Blue Mountains], but the place was so foggy that we can't see anything.

At least we could try the Skyway to cross the cannon and the steep Railway.
