Second day in Yogya as local call their city and day 97th in my [tour]({{site.url }}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days) and finally I've got a cold, I just hope the pill I took help me to recover and avoid to have the flu in the last part of my trip.

But, with a cold or the flu, I have a mission to accomplish, explore the city. Fortunately, the folks from [Skyshi](http://skyshi.com) guide me to couple place in Yogya.

Firstly, we had a brunch in a lovely Javanese restaurant, where we could enjoy some delicious dishes from local cuisine and talk about our countries to learn each other about our current situations.

Secondly, we visited the [Ullen Sentalu Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullen_Sentalu_Museum) in theory is a museum about Javanese culture, but the reality is that it's a museum about the Sultan family, Yogyakarta by law have a governor, but is not elected the governor is the current Sultan.
