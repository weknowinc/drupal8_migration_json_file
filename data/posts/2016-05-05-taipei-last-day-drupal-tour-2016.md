To finish my short visit to Taipei, I decided to learn something about local and recent history, so went out into the [National Museum of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_History) of Taiwan.

The museum was OK, but the problem they used old ceramic, sculpture to tell their history. I am not said is not valid but wasn't the kind of history I was looking for; one acclamation is about the word **old** when I say old is old, several objects were label as made about six millenniums ago.

Fortunately, I have the company of the new residence [Kering Corrales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kering-corrales-89815683) self-imported from Costa Rica, he could provide some comments about the beauty of the exposition, thanks for that.

In the afternoon I flu to Manila, Philippines to participate as Keynote and speaker in [DrupalCamp Manila 2016](2016.drupalcampmanila.com)
