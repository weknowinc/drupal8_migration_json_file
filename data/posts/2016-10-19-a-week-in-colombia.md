Last week  I had the opportunity to back to Colombia as para of my tour [Around the Drupal world in 140+ days](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-day).

To be honest, this stop wasn't planned, during my visit to France the border control officer inform to me about a situation with my passport, I was almost done with the space for new stamps. That situation forces me to try to get a new passport as soon as possible; After checking to Colombian embassy in Costa Rica, I confirm that renew my passport in Costa Rica wasn't an option due the return time. For that reason, I have to travel to Colombia to renew my passport there.

With this un expected trip I tried to use in as many activities I could. In Drupal Side, I participated in a Drupal Meetup organized by [Seed](http://seed.com.co), and particularly by [Aldibier Morales](http://www.aldibier.com/). They rent and space and organize the event to enable me to talk about Drupal Console and Drupal Community in general, I enjoy the **Q & A** session, where I could provide some points of view I have about how to handle local communities.

With my new passport on my hands, I start a marathon to visit my mother and father familly located in Bucaramanga, Santader. Was really good because for many years I haven't visit them.

So, as many time in my #enzotour16 I overcome the adversities and transform in something positive as much I could it.
