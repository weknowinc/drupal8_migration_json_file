Yesterday was a contribute day; I continue working on a new generator for [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole) **generate:post:update**, this command will be available in next release.

In the evening, I had my first contact with the Australia Drupal community where they gave me a space to share with them the current status of **Drupal Console** project. The audience was small, but the interest big, and a lot of question came up, I just hope I could provide good answers.

Before the meetup, I did some a little of sightseeing visiting:

- [St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral,_Melbourne)
- [Australian Centre for the Moving Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Centre_for_the_Moving_Image)
