I have to recognize I have Jet Lag issues; I can't sleep more that 4 hours in a row. But this the biggest time difference I have traveled before in my life, so I expect in a week, or so my circadian rhythm gets use to the change.

As a result, today I get up a little late, so I decided to visit temples, the first one was the [Siddhivinayak Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhivinayak_Temple,_Mumbai), the template was so crowded with queue about 200 meters, but at least, the line moves faster, so the wait was about 10 minutes. After passing the "security control", I have to remove my shoes, and everybody was offering flowers to their god, and I saw there is something related to coconut waterm that I can't understand. Sadly pictures weren't allowed.

In general, a quick visit, and excellent if you want to try to live the experience of an Indian temple.

After finish this temple I walk around two hours with a real destination, I just want to explore to see how looks the real Mumbai and to find a place to take a lunch. I have to say Mumbai is indeed a city of contrast. On one hand you can see a lot of small informal business and people almost living in streets and on the other side of the same street, a vast complex of building for offices of people working for multinationals companies or hotel lie Four Season in the middle of that neighborhoods.

Almost in front of Four Seasons hotel, there is a tiny restaurant where I order Fish and a tomato soup. Because, in my mind I have the idea how a Tomato soup could be spicy, and I didn't say "no spice please", and guest what the did it the spiciest tomato soup I tried in my life and I could handle. 

Anyhow, I continue my route to visit the [Haji Ali Dargah](http://www.hajialidargah.in), and I have to say that doesn't look like pictures, the place is running down. 

Returning home, I got notified by [Ani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anigupta) that there is a pre-party meet up at [Rude Lounge](https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/rude-lounge-hill-road-bandra-west) were we met with [Dasjo]((http://dasjo.at), [klausinho](https://twitter.com/_klausi_), [Rachit gupta](https://www.drupal.org/u/rachit_gupta) and others Drupal that I don't have contact, shame on me. Good food, good place and nice talk the perfect combination to close a day.
