After [1st Drupal Camp Vietnam]({{site.url }}/articles/2016/03/05/1st-drupalcamp-vietnam) we have almost two days to spare to continue learning more about culture and Vietnam history.

Today we decided to visit the [Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum), the entry is free, but, there is a queue about three blocks to getting into the mausoleum. Photos or videos are not allowed. 

Inside there is the cadaver of **Ho Chi Minh**, the schedule to visit is tied, only four hours per day and Mondays, and Fridays is close. 

Is important to mention that during February is not possible to visit the thumb of Ho Chi Minh, due, his corpse is taken to Russia for his maintenance.

Next to the Mausoleum, you can visit the some installation used by Ho Chi Minh. Meanwhile, he was the leader of Vietnam.

In the afternoon, we visit the **Ho Chi Minh Museum** dedicated to the late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh and Vietnam's revolutionary struggle against foreign powers.

To end the date we just pack our luggage to try to be ready for our travel to South Korea.
