Yesterday I arrived in Osaka by bus without any inconvenience; I will stay in an a room provides by [Annai Inc](https://annai.co.jp/) community leaders in Japan.

Instead of going out to do some sightseeing, I prefer to stay to do some laundry, share lunch with Annai Inc team and get prepare for the Drupal Cafe No 44 organized by **Annai Inc**.

At night, I have a session about [Drupal Console](http://console.com), [Satoshi Kino](https://www.facebook.com/satoshi.kino) helps me with translation to Japanese, that was a nice touch; there were almost 20 attendees, all eager for understanding the Drupal Console details. Later **Annai** sponsor some drinks and food for everybody in the activity.

Especial thanks to Kyoko and Satoshi for being awesome organizers in Tokyo and Osaka.
