Yesterday, we learned a little bit about Australian culture; we watched a game of the national sports *Footy* also called football,   Australian football, or Aussie rules for foreigners.

The game was between [St Kilda](http://www.saints.com.au/) Vs [Freemantle](http://www.fremantlefc.com.au/). The game is an intermediate point between [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) and [rubgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football), but the usage of the word football is accurate because they use a lot their feets.

Some interesting thing I notice:

- Nine umpires
- They have like coach assistances they can get on the field during the game to provide instructions.
- The Waterboys are allowed to get on the field during the match.

In summary was a good game St Kilda defeat Freemantle 101 - 67, but was a vibrant play, I could say I enjoy it. In total, we were 17.927 attendees, but the stadium looks empty so the total capacity must be about 75.000.

To finish our day, we ate seafood noodles.
