As part of my preparation for DrupalCamp Chongqing  I have to stop a little bit my sightseeing to finish my tweaks in my, Drupal Console slides to add the latest features and finish my keynote slides.

Also, I work a little bit in [Anexus](http://anexusit.com) doing a research of an issue related with Drupal [Commerce](https://drupalcommerce.org) and Search API and expose filters. I have to reckon that I never use Search API and his integration with **Drupal Commerce**, but I am glad that I could understand how works and fix the problem.

Also, I participate in the weekly podcast about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project named **The China plugin**, where we talked about next event, latest changes and what is coming on the project next weeks.

As part of my preparation for DrupalCamp, I change my hotel to another which is located two blocks from the venue, to avoid get lost in translation.

In the afternoon, I continue my next trip planning and with a help of my [wife](http://yersika.com) I bought my flight ticket from Indonesia to Melbourne, Australia, you know all good goes to and ending.

At evening, the organizer set up a dinner for all speaker and as usual was delicious and spicy.
