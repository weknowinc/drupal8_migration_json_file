Second day in DrupalCon Asia and the first official day of the event.

Today I attend for the first time a pre-note, and I have to say that was hilarious, and people get involve in the activity, at the end the audience was invited to do a flash mob Indian style, and the stage was totally crowded.

After, Dries, as usual, start with the keynote where I notice the Indian and Asian community are more participative than I believe.

As part of my confibution to DrupalCon Asia, I lead a session to talk about the importance to have tools a content generated in our mother tongue and not only English.

Regarding sessions, I attend the following:

- [Drupal8 Theming - No more divitis](https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/drupal8-theming-no-more-divitis)
- [Everything multilingual in Drupal 8](https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/everything-multilingual-drupal-8)
- [The largest Drupal 8 sites on Earth, and the NP8 news portal distribution] (https://events.drupal.org/asia2016/sessions/largest-drupal-8-sites-earth-and-news-portal-distribution-they-use-np8)

Besides the sessions, the environment in sponsors area was just crazy a lot of people trying to hire people and getting new leads for new projects.

In summary, the event is named a DrupalCon and, to be honest,  smells and have the feeling of a real DrupalCon, well-done organizers. 

To fish my day, I have a good chat and dinner with some folks from UK that lives in Thailand, I will meet with then again in Bangkok in two months.
