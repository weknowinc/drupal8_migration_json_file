Yesterday was my day 35 in my 120ish travel trip; I am not complaining, but my body felts a little tired, how I notice that usually I sleep only 6 hours or less and yesterday I overslept. So, I decided to stay longer in my room and review some work I have pending.

After taking a great lunch, I decided to go to [Tsukiji Fish Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukiji_fish_market), originally I have the plan to be there about 5 am, I am glad now I got overslept, because, the market is close one day a month and yesterday were that day of the month. I will visit when I return to Tokyo.

With my plan altered I just found a Buddhism temple, this the first temple I found in Japan, it's weird because, in theory, more that 60% of people is Buddhism.

The next stop was at the Museum of Innovation and Science or [Miraikan](http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/), they have a lot of future usages of technology usage. The most impressive thing, is a 10 minutes demo of [Asimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO) robot and other robots.
