Melbourn it's also culture and history, for that reason I visited with [Yersika](http://www.yersika.com) the [National Gallery of  Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Victoria), to be honest, I can't really appreciate art, but they have a couple of interesting pieces.

Our second stop was in the [Shrine_of_Remembrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine_of_Remembrance) in honor Australian forces.
