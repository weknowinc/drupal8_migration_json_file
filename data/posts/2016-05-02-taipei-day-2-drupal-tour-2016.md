Another cloudy day in Taipei, so I skip again I had to postpone the visit to the **Taipei 101** building. Instead of I visit today other temples.

My first temple was [Xingtian Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Tian_Kong); I was surprised because again the temple was crowded and in the middle of a religious service, I expect some time just to feel the environment.

Later on, I visited the [Taipei Confucius Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Confucius_Temple), a beautiful complex that includes some artist performance some Asian instruments.

Almost in next door,  is located the [Baoan Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalongdong_Baoan_Temple) which is the biggest temple in Taipei and declared as UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage in 2003.

At that moment, I was tired of seeing temples, and I want to do something more mundane; So against my rules, I decided to try to find a movie theater to watch **Civil War** the latest Marvel movie. 

Using my phone, I found a movie theater near to a metro station, wasn't hard to find, but I was expecting a mall with a cinema complex inside, but instead I found and small and independent movie theater, happily I could check the film was available in English with Chinese traditional subtitles. Being sincere I have to confess that I always use English subtitles to watch a movie if it's not available in Spanish, but I could say I understand about 80% of the film.

Looking for something to eat I visited the [Shilin Night Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_Night_Market) a colorful place, especially regarding food variety; as a good tourist, I bought some stuff and ate in the traditional food court in the market.
