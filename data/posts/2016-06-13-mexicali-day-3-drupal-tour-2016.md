All good things come to an end, and this trip is not the exception. Yesterday I leave Mexico and back to home which is Heredia, Costa Rica where my family is waiting for me.

I had a mix of feelings happy, sad, fullness and emptiness, but certainly   satisfy of complete a dream I had since a child, travel around the world in a similar way that did **Phileas Fogg** in the book [Around the World in Eighty Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days).

How was my return? well since I am Mexico with friends they say goodbye with an awesome Mexican breakfast to try 'Menudo' at a restaurant named *Museo de Mexicali*, they built a western town around with all old pieces, quite picturesque I have to say.

Later on, I took the first fly off two to return home in 10 hours travel to back home.

I was so happy to be abe to hug my kids, mother, and siblings, now I have to just my really, not back to reality because traveling is part of my reality and happily my family understands that part of me.
