Early in the morning I departure from Jakarta fro Yogyakarta, located in the same [Java Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java) in Indonesia.

Due I will be only a few days in the city and tomorrow is Monday I try to visit the remote and important sport out the city,  So I hire a car/drive to pick me up at the airport and start my personal tour.

Firstly, I visited the [Prambanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan) compound; this complex is dated from 9th century. It's the biggest agglomeration of Hinduist temples in the world; this place is part of UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The area is well preserved, and you can climb in the temples, I love this experience.

Secondly, I stop in [Borobudur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur) another 9th-century construction, but in this case is the biggest Buddhist temple in the world. The organization of this temples is extraordinarily complex and beautiful. Indeed a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In the end, I try to visit the Merapi Volcano Observatory⁠⁠⁠, but I couldn't because I arrive too late to try to walk the 4+ km trek and do something like that alone in the middle of Indonesia Jungle, looks like is not a smart idea even for me.
