After a break to sightseeing, yesterday return to the road, my first stop was at [Lu Xun Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun_Park_(Shanghai)), in this park is located the [Lu Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Xun) thumb, he was the most prominent writer of Chinese literature during their revolution.

The park was gorgeous, but, maybe the most impressive thing was some people doing [Thai Chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi) and some local dance style that I can't identify.

After the park, I decided to go to the center and do some random walk, and suddenly I face a ferry service, and I decided to take that to wherever destination due it was so cheap I don't expect a long trip. In the other side, I realize the service was to cross the [Huangpu River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_River) to the financial district, so I just walk around that and take a nice walk to the shore of the river.

As you maybe know I am a soup person and in Asia I am a noodle person, so I got a noodle and continued my way to meet with **Clark** who helps me to practice some Chinese words, and we share a coffee that I was able to order by myself thanks his guidance.
