I was reluctant to visit a Zoo, but I didn't find something more appropriate to see on my last day in Jakarta.

To be honest, the Zoo was better that I expected, big spaces and "enough" space for the animals; You know there is nothing better than freedom.

The most impulsive animal I saw was the Comodo Dragon; I never saw a specimen in real life and it's daunting in size and shape.

The second one was a tiger that was roaring; the roar was loud that I was watching another animal with my headset playing music, and still I can listen to something that takes my attention.
