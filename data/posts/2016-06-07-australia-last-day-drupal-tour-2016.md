Keep calm and Bondi Beach. After the storm, the calm doesn't return completely but indeed ins quite better, the day is still gray but not rainfall and no windy.

In our last day in Australia, we decided to do a short visit to the legendary [Bondi Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_Beach) the view is spectacular and despite the temperature and the high waves, some courageous swimmers and surfer try their luck in the ocean.
