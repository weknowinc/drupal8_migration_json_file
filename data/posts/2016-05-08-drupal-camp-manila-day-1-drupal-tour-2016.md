I was impressed with how international the Drupal Camp Manila was, with speakers from ten countries and sponsors from four countries, by far is one the most international events of Drupal I had attended.

The assistance was about 200, again don't trust in my appreciation. I was honor by leading the Drupal Camp Keynote; in my talk, I present about "Why investing in community is good business".

Also, I did a session about Drupal Console, but this time was more advanced than usual, because some attendees from Singapore, Vietnam and Japon already watch the basic introduction during my [enzotour16](enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/)

I attended some interesting sessions like Twig in Drupal 8, BeHat, Scrum among others.
