Today we started our day with a breakfast with "Rat" a Chinese drupaler who lives in Singapore a long time ago. Rat is a Physic person by education by Drupal user since 2007.

After that, we continue our tour to Sentosa area, to visit the S.E.A aquarium where we spend hours because we are an aquarium person, I have to recognize it's an excellent aquarium and in my personal experience with aquarium only supered by Atlanta Aquarium.

At the end of day, we move towards the [Pixel Onion](http://www.pixelonion.com/) headquarters, due they host a Drupal Meetup in Singapore today and allow me to talk about Drupal 8 and [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project. They said this was one of the biggest session they held until now.

I have to say I really enjoy the session and the conversation we had at the end with some snacks, and looks like we have a few new Drupal 8 and Drupal Console fans.

To end my day I attend the two hours meeting "Meet your candidate" for Drupal Association elections for Director at large; You can see the video here:
