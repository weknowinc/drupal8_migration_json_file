I took the term [Stormageddon](http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/stormageddon-weather-pummels-nsw-dims-vivid-festival-floods-23-river-systems-20160604-gpbnzg.html) from a local newspaper about the storm that is causing disasters in the east of Australia mainly with floods in different neighborhoods.

To be honest, I didn't realize the level of damages until I saw the news at the end of the day.

Maybe I am stubborn, but I reject the idea of stay all day in the hotel because a *'rain'*; So, We tried to do some indoor activities visiting some museums and churches, here my list and some pictures.

At the end as many other courageous visitors of the city, we end up our day totally soak and without workable umbrellas due the strong winds.
