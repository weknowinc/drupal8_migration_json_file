In an effort to try to live a little more about the Thai experience. I decided to visit the city of [Ayutthaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phra_Nakhon_Si_Ayutthaya_(city)) located 80 kilometres from **Bangkok**.

 To reach this place I decided to use the train because looks easy to do and it was, I took a second class ticket in the morning in a wagon with fans and returning and first class wagon with air condition.

In **Ayutthaya** I hire a [tuk-tuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw) for me, who promise to lead to all tourist sightseeing places in a marathon of 4 hours. I took because the driver was very kind and he spoke English, on the other hand, I found the price reasonable.

He leads me out to places like [Wat Chaiwatthanaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Chaiwatthanaram), [Wat Phra Si Sanphet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Chaiwatthanaram), [Wat Ratchaburana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Ratchaburana,_Ayutthaya) among other I could find in google, so just let me share some pictures.

As you can imagine, I finish my tour with a delicious Thai food for lunch.

I totally recommend this place to visit, everyday I found this place more interesting and I want to come back.
