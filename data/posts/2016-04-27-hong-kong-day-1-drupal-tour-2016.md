As I said before, for my Hong Kong is not China, for many reasons. First, one Hong Kong citizens don't have the same rights as other Chinese folks in the mainland ( Mainland identify areas outside Hong Kong and Macau). B. They have a different system of visas than Mainland and C. They are more English oriented than the rest of China.

Yesterday, I decided to don't visit a particular place, instead of I just visit some public spaces to feel the city, my first stop was in [Kowloon Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park) a big green area in Hong Kong, which is weird, due the high prices of land. This place as I expected was full of Senior citizens practicing Thai Chi; the park is also used for cultural representation, and there is an Aviary in the middle of the park.

Later on, I went out to the [West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park), The area is under construction, but the Promenade is still there, with a good view of Hong Kong, but Hong Kong was cloudy, so the pictures are not totally clear.

After that, I walked in direction to [Tsim Sha Tsui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsim_Sha_Tsui) to see the promenade located there and take a ferry from [Victoria Harbur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour)

In the other side is located the Hong Kong island, so I just roam between a network of bridges that connect upscale shopping malls, before to took a train to visit Dried Seafood Street located at [Des Voeux Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Voeux_Road]. I was expecting something like a Chinatown but was clean and organized, but the food of course very exotic.

At night, I met with my friend **Jackie Chang** from [BootDev](http://bootdev.com) to have a dinner and later on see other folks for a Drupal Happy Hour meetup.
