Living the America (The continent not in the USA), our knowledge about Asia is very limited, China is not the exception. In general, we only knew about few cities in China, Bejing or Peking, Shanghai and Hong Kong ( I know Hong Kong is a king of a country).

With that in context, I could say yesterday I travel the middle of nowhere in China real mainland. [Chongching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing) it's like a second level city in China. But don't get confuse with that title; because the metro area has 30+ million residents, that mean is bigger that [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City) and [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai).

Chongqing is located close to the Tibet and by close I mean 1500 kilometres, but is the closer than my usual location, I will miss this time,  I have to left something unseen to have an excuse to return.

My flight was good just almost 3 hours and  [Qiangjun Ran](http://ranqiangjun.com) with other members of the local Drupal community were waiting for me to lead me to my hotel. Later on, they invited me to eat a [Hot Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot) and I survive, of course, they told me they choose a beginner level for me.

After dinner, we have a walk around the are just to get familiar and reduce the changes I get lost the next days, I really appreciate that, Chongqing guys are excellent hosts.
