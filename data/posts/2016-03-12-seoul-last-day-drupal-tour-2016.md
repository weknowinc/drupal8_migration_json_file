Yesterday was officially my last day in Seoul; I  use part of the day to practice a **Drupal 8** introductory session I will lead next Tuesday at [CI&T Tokyo](http://www.ciandt.com/card/tokyo-japan) offices, before my Drupal Console session.

After a brunch, I move toward the [War Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial_of_Korea) museum.

This museum was interesting, and big 25% is dedicated to the history of Korean folks since 2000 B.C and their battles.

The rest of the museum, focus his attention on the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and their current conflict.

I have to say, was weird as Colombian to see for first time in my life, a mention of Colombia in an International War.
