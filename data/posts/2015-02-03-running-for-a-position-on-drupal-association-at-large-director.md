So let me tell you something about my and my motivations to propose my name.

#About Me

Colombian by birth, Costa Rican by choice, I have spent the last 13 years living in that narrow piece of land between North and South America. I co-founded and have been running a successful Drupal workshop called AnexusIT. I am 38, married and father of two brilliant kids: Axel and Zoe. I enjoy long walks through the hallways of Drupal Groups and have a knack for putting together community events.

I got into Drupal 6 in early 2008 after working for many years building websites from scratch using PHP and after many months contributing to a couple of PHP projects with the intention to automate the way websites were built.

#Experience

My first Drupal project was a real challenge simply because the deadlines were very tight (surprise surprise) and I had no idea how to start working on that thing. I was even the one who had to lead the way and teach others. Anyway, the process was very frustrating but even that the project was delivered with a delay of a few days I ended up hating the project but loving the CMS platform.

My first contact with the community was in 2009 at the 1st Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua were I did two lectures and learn a lot about the community and how strong the product could be.

After two years working for other’s companies doing Drupal, I took the decision to start the first Drupal oriented workshop in Costa Rica around 2010. AnexusIT was the first company of it’s kind in Central America. I lead the technological and technical areas of the company. I get to wear many hats but Chief Technology Officer is my official title. My favorite role though, is Drupal developer, where I get to motivate, lead, supervise and encourage my peers while still coding for at least 8 hours every single day.

After the Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua I started to organising Drupal Meetups in Costa Rica and building up the Drupal community in Costa Rica. As result, we organised   the 1st Drupal Camp Costa Rica (and 3rd Drupal Camp Centroamericano) in late 2011. We have been hosting this event in Costa Rica yearly with the latest edition being held on August 2014.

During all this time I was leading the community in Costa Rica without an official title, because we were lacking a formal structure. To remediate that, in January 2015, we (the community) founded a NGO called “Drupal Costa Rica” where I am the co-founder and first President. We are planning on using the NGO to facilitate the chores of putting together Drupal activities in Costa Rica.

#Motivation

In recent years the DA has started looking more world-oriented with the inclusion of members from Europe and Australia, but even that the vision is still through the eyes of people from high develop countries.

After some conversations with a friend from Vietnam <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/webtomme/" target="_blank">Tom Soqyu</a> about experiences of activities aimed at building a Drupal community and tasks oriented to create the First Drupal in Vietnam we detect we face similar problems because we live in non developer countries or emerging markets if you want to use other term.


So what ideas I will support in Drupal association, well I love initiatives to sponsor speakers to training people in emergent countries specially if they speak the language of emerging country and french and english in many countries in africa. If I get a position in Drupal Association I will support project in that direction.

So based in my experience of 5 years working with Drupal as Developer, Community Lead and Company Owner in an emergent country I want to bring to DA a different perspective about our challenges and ideas about how to improve the presence of Drupal in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
