I had the opportunity to participate in the Hong Kong Drupal meetup. I have to say I liked their format; their schedule starts at 7 pm, But they reserve 1 hour to let people talk each other to enforce the networking and to allow people who to have some issues reaching to the place don't miss the sessions.

The first session was lead by **Jackie Chan** from [BootDev](http://bootdev.com) where he share how DrupalCamp China was 2016](http://drupalcampchina.org/drupal%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%90%A5-2016/sessions/drupalconsole) held in Shanghai; maybe we will see a Drupal day or DrupalCamp Hong Kong soon.

Later on, I have the opportunity to present my session about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole) including a live demo; People were keen about the product and the reception was incredible.

During day time as part of my sightseeing in Hong Kong I visited the [Hong Kong Museum of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Museum_of_History) and the [Wong Tai Sin Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Tai_Sin_Temple_(Hong_Kong))
