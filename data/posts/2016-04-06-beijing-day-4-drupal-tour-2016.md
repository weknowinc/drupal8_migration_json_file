One of the most interesting things about China is their history and how their people react with their values. Yesterday  I went to the [Mausoleum of Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Mao_Zedong) to see how to be loved is he nowadays.

Chinese people mostly visit this place, I was one of the only few foreigners in the place, and I could fell that people truly loved him especially people with 40+ years old.

To continue with my cultural interaction, I visit the [National Museum of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_China), the museum is vast and is normal because covering thousands of years of history is not an easy task.

Maybe the most interest thing is that they have a calligraphy exposition in several rooms, to be honest, everything looks the same for me, and I don't have the culture to understand the beauty, but is the same with art for me.

To finish my day I have a dinner with **Wang Jian** from [Think Drupal](http://thinkindrupal.com)
