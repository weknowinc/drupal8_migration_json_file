I reach the day 50 of my [trip]({{site.url}}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days), so I still have 70 days in my front full of new adventures and experiences, new friends and a lot of Drupal.

Yesterday, I didn't do anything in regards of sightseeing, instead of I participate in a hangout with the rest of [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) team to try to define next step to try to have our first 1.0.0-alpha version after [Drupal](http://drupal.org) 8.1 gets released.

After have a brunch and departure towards the Indonesian to pick up my passport and my visa to travel to Indonesia. With my visa confirm now I need to define if I will visit Jakarta or Bali or maybe both.

Continuing with community activities, I visited the offices of [Davyin Internet Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/davyin-internet-solutions); I have the opportunities to share my experiences of having a Drupal Workshop in a growing Drupal community. Also, I could do a demo of **Drupal Console** for them.

Finally at night, I had a dinner with other members of Drupal Shanghai community.
