Today was my first day in China; I spend my morning into activities, the first one and crucial, figure out how to get connected to the services I regularly use in Costa Rica. Thankfully to some friends I could get connected using my computer and my phone. 

The second activity was explained [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) to the [Bootdev](http://www.bootdev.com) folks.

I tried to get a sim card with Internet, but is only possible by a Chinese citizen with ID, so I could today I have to figure out soon because I am using a printed version of the metro map, how old style is that :P.

In the afternoon, I decided to go our alone to try to understand the city and the metro, so, I visited the [Shanghai Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Museum). That museum has a good representation of Chinese culture; I could visit the coin section because they were about to close the museum so that I will return tomorrow.

At home, I have to plan my next day, because without the internet is more probably to get lost.

To end the day, I have a dinner with [Jackie Chang](https://chankongching.wordpress.com/) from **Bootdev**, who explain to me some aspects about Chinese society, meanwhile we enjoy a **Hot Pot** dinner.
