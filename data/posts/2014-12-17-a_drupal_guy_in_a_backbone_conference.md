<img style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;;" src="{{site.url }}/assets/img/backbonejs_logo.png"/> Past Dic 15th and 16th I attend the 3rd Backbone Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

I'm a Drupal Backend Developer, so my experience in Front End is limited to small pets projects I have been working just for fun like <a href="http://github.com/enzolutions/generator-marionette-drupal" target="_blank">http://github.com/enzolutions/generator-marionette-drupal</a>.

To be honest Backend Developers speaking generally, we underestimate the work of Front End Developers do.

Even I have been playing with Backbone for last 10 months I didn't have huge expectations about this conference, but eager to get new knowledge. In general I had the idea people will present tons of plugins for instance jQuery plugins.

But I'm glad to say I was totally wrong, after 5 minutes of the first conference I was totally lost between patterns and architecture decision inside the framework.

In general I notice jQuery is a set of tools two generations behind of current implementations.

Also I love how open the community is, because they had conferences talking from Wordpress to competitors like <a href="https://ampersandjs.com/" target="_blank">AmpersanJS</a> and others.

All lectures are available in video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgxAbM67lYIGw8DnANC7VgREbzJRQged" target="_blank">here</a>.

These are my favorites.

So what is the next for me, well I will try to continue trying to learn more about Front End libraries and frameworks but now I will see with the respect they deserve.
