After lunch two of the organizers **Paul de Paula** and **Gem Devanedera** invite me to their home.

His place is located at [Tanay, Rizal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanay,_Rizal) two and a half hours from Manila in the mountains and close to [Laguna de Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_de_Bay); the biggest lake in the Philippines I will explore that tomorrow.

With then I could feel a more local Pilipino experience, like **Halo Halo**. Pork and Fish
