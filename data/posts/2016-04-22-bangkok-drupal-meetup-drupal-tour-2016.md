I am in the second half of my Enzo Tour 2016, the main reason to be in Bangkok was to participate in their Drupal Meetup.

The Drupal meetup was organized by [Fluxus](http://www.fluxus.io/), I met these guys in Mumbai, India during DrupalCon and after that in Hanoi during their first DrupalCamp, so as you can see they are all about community.

As you can imagine, I did an introduction to Drupal 8.1 and [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com)

I have to thank you to [Sven Berg Ryen](http://x-team.com/profile/sven-ryen/) from Norway who attend this meeting after having a flight of 12 hours from Oslo and be in an immense jet lag.

Before the Drupal Meetup, I did some sightseeing in Bangkok. I went out to the [Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananta_Samakhom_Throne_Hall) an exhibition of the Masterpieces of Thailand, sorry no pictures because they aren't allowed, but I could tell you I never saw that amount of gold in my life and the quality of pieces is really astonishing.
