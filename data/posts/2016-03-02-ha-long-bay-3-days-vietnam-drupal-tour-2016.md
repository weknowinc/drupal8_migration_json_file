I expect the last three days on a tour in [Ha-long Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay) area, which is a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** with about almost two thousand islets.

The tour was two nights and three days, one night we slept anchor close to a harbour and the second night was in [Monkey Island ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island), In our tour were includes two activities visiting  **Dau Go Cave** cave and doing kayak around those islands.

I have to say the boat was comfortable; the trip was quite peaceful because te ocean looks more like a lagoon, I use The Internet on my first night using my phone, was almost a miracle that I have signal at that place.

The second night, I use hotel lobby WI-FI, which was more stable and perfect to review some pending tasks and finish the updates required for my session in [DrupalCamp Vietnam](http://drupalcamp.vn).

Vietnam is still in winter and the ocean is still cold, only for brave people :P.

In my return, I notice that [@drupal](https://twitter.com/drupal) account in twitter report my tour to the global community, that was more than awesome.
