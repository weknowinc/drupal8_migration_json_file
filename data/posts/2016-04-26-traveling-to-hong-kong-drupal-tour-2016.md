In my last half day in Bangkok, I decided to stay at home and do some planning of sightseeing in Hong Kong, by the way, I am glad that I can use the web app [Visit a City](http://www.visitacity.com) to create a schedule for my three days in Hong Kong.

Also, I did some planning with my wife to try to visit three days and two night [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania), and I realize two facts, A. Tasmania is bigger than Costa Rica, B. That will be the most south place I have been visited in my life.

In the flight, I have the opportunity to finish the book "The Fifth Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Woman) written by [Henning Mankell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell). I bought this book in a library in [Lewes, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes_District) as part of a personal challenge to read literature in English among other books, and I left behind in Hong Kong.

I abandon the book with a note to the person who find the book request to read and lead behind too or just give the book to someone else.
