My last stop in Indonesia was Bali, yeah the famous Bali, the place that everybody was to visit, well I am here.

Bali has almost the same population of Costa Rica in a 10% of his space; But, believe me, or not there more than beaches in Bali and I am here to participate in a Drupal meetup with local web developers.

Suryanto the organizer said was a success with 12 attendees, so I was happy to hear that.
