At home, I found the order that **Jackie Chang** did for me in [Taobao](http://taobao.com), so the order only takes about 36 hours, that was so quickly. I was having some issues with my computer backpack zippers, so I decided to buy a sleeve for my computer to throw my computer bag, and when I go back home, I will buy a new one and also, I bought a GoPro stick.

In total, I paid 50% of the price of the official GoPro stick for both products.
