Starting in a new city never is easy, Taipei is not perfect, but works well, even that I got lost for a moment after took a bus I could fix my issue relatively quick.

This weekend is a long weekend due the labor day on Monday; I was alert about I will find all really crowded but not really. 

I could split the sightseeing I did yesterday in three categories.

In the religious category, I visited three temples yesterday.

- **Jiantan Temple**
- [Longshan Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengjia_Longshan_Temple)
- **Qingshan Temple**

Among of those temples, the most interesting was the **Longshan Temple** and wasn't about the temple, was about people, Becuase inside were about half thousand people, chanting song and praying to their goods, was a nice experience.

About cultural section I visited, the [National Palace Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Palace_Museum); To be honest, I didn't really enjoy this place, maybe too much art, pottery, and calligraphy and I don't have the culture or knowledge to understand that.

Regards national symbols, I went out to [Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek_Memorial_Hall), this memorial honor the father of their country; I know it's delicate subject saying Taiwan is a country, but looks like a country and smell like a country.  In general a big plaza and a nice monument and they a changing guard show.
