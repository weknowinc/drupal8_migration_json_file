Hong is bigger than I expected, and some stuff I want to do required 2 hours travel each way, so I have to change my plans.

After reviewing my options I went out to [Man Mo Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Mo_Temple_(Hong_Kong)) which is a small but beautiful temple, actually looks like those millennial places we usually saw in Kung Fu movies

After lunch, I return to my place, to work a little bit with other [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) maintainers. I share with them my idea of increase the level complexity in our introduction session for Drupal Console; they agreed and, I will use that starting in [Drupal Camp Manila](http://2016.drupalcampmanila.com) next week.

Later on, I walked in Nathan Street just to the environment and visited the [Temple Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Street,_Hong_Kong) and Lady's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Choi_Street) markets, both places where do you could find anything do you have in mind, I didn't buy anything due I wasn't looking for something.

At night, I visited with **Jackie** and  **Kevin** from [Bootdev](http://bootdev), Jackie's parent's house, where his parents prepare a delicious dinner using Hongkonese style.
