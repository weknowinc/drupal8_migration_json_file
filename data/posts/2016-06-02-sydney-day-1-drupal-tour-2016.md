My first Day as a tourist in Sydney had a lot of activities at not all of them related with tourist. 

My first one was in the offices of [Technocrat](http://technocrat.com.au) HQ, where [ Vladimir Roudakov](https://twitter.com/VladimirAus) invite me to do a video interview to talk about [tour](enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/), and of course, about [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) be in contact to see the final cut soon.

For lunch, I met with [Adam Malone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamdmalone) who as usual is doing business travel, but he manages to have a meal with us just before to departure to Melbourne.

In the afternoon we walk in the [Royal Botanic Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Garden,_Sydney) and of course, we ended up in the [Mrs. Macquarie's Point](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/sydney/sights/parks-gardens/mrs-macquaries-point) to have the mandatory picture with the Opera House in the background.

A lot of people said that the [State Library of NSW](www.sl.nsw.gov.au/) is a more beautiful building that their counterpart in Melbourne; but IMHO, the [Melboure Victoria Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Library_of_Victoria) is more gorgeous. 

In the library, we have the opportunity of seeing a [World Press Photo 16](http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2016) winners exposition.

After having a recovery nap in our hotel, we explore the city at night, because this week the [Vivid Sydney Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivid_Sydney] is happening, which is music, light and art festival around the city. The festival is breathtaking, and we could have the opportunity if took a lot of pictures.
