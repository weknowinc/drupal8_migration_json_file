Another day in the tropic and I decided to visit one of the main spots for tourists in Bangkok, which is the [Grand Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palace).

Maybe was the fact was crowded as hell and the weather was heat as hell too, but I didn't enjoy this place as much as the rest of Thailand. But the place is beautiful; it's just too dense regarding buildings and temples.

For me, the most important aspect of my tour is about to meet people and having lunch with [Sven](https://www.drupal.org/u/svenryen) from Norway, that change my mood in a good way.

Finally, I visit the [Lumphini Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumphini_Park), as many parks in many cities is full of playgrounds, lake, boat, finding and why not giant lizards. Yep did you read correctly giant lizards, I don't know the reason bu they are there among kids, they look almost like Comodo Dragons.
