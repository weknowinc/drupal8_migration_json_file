Last week  I had the opportunity of visit Paris, France for a week as para of my tour [Around the Drupal world in 140+ days](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-day).

Sadly for me, I got a #drupalflu in Drupal Con, Dublin; So I wasn't in the best shape to enjoy the city.

I want to say thank you to [Sebastien Lissarrague](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lissarraguesebastien) and his family for allowing me to stay with them in their home.

During my visit, I had the opportunity to participate in the local Drupal Meetup of Paris community.

Also, I visited some companies like [Koriolis](http://www.koriolis.fr), [Sensio Labs](https://sensiolabs.com) and [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/).

At **Koriolis** I have the opportunity to show the owner and developers the [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project to accelerate the Drupal 8 adoption in their projects.

During my visit to **Sensio Labs** I had a session with part the Symfony Core development team, to show them how we have been using the [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) in Drupal Console project.

During my visit at **Platform.sh** I learn I little bit how they enable to their Drupal 8 user the usage of Drupal Console project. Next week I will write an articule about that.

About the city, I think anything that I could say about Paris will be nothing compare how beautiful it's; I just could recommend you to visit three mandatory places in you visit.
