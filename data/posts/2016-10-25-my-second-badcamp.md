Last week I had the opportunity of participating in my second [BADCamp](2016.badcamp.net) as part of my tour [Around the Drupal world in 140+ days](http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-day).


My first assistance was in 2012, a lot have changed from that time to now. At that time I was only assistant and was impress for the quality of the event and how vibrant was the community in San Francisco Bay Area.

The event itself doesn't change too much, the same venue, but a little more disperse in my opinion.

  
What change was my participation with [Jesus Manuel Olivas](http://jmolivas.com) one of my business partners at  [weKnow](http://weknowinc.com). We lead a training about Drupal 8 module development
